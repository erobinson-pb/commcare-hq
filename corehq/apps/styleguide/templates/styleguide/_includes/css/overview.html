        Good styling code is reusable, DRY, and semantic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of us donâ€™t write much CSS. HQ uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a>, which
        gives us a consistent and fairly comprehensive set of styles. Most of the "styling" we do is
        picking the appropriate Bootstrap (or HQ) classes and then troubleshooting anything unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> to write styles. LESS is a fairly simple extension
        of CSS that allows for more maintainable and reusable styling by supporting variables, mixins, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reusable CSS is good for the same reasons reusable code is good everywhere else. On the front end,
        reusable code is also correlated with visual consistency and generally better UX. To that end, when
        creating a new page or section:
        <ul>
            <li>It should look very similar to related HQ pages.</li>
            <li>It should look fairly similar to other HQ pages.</li>
            <li>It should look somewhat like the rest of the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        Bootstrap takes care of a lot this: it gives us a consistent framework so our pages look like each other,
        and that framework is designed to resemble the rest of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Good styling is <strong>semantic</strong>, because that makes it easier for other developers to reuse.
        Ideally, a visual designer decides what an error looks like, or what a CRUD page looks like, and then
        developers only need to determine that they're displaying an error, or creating a CRUD page, and the look
        and feel is taken care of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Classes like <code>.bump-down { margin-top: 10px; }</code> are problematic because it isn't clear when
        and why they should be used, so they get applied inconsistently and we end up with a site that looks
        a little bit...off...but it isn't obvious why. Bootstrap is a good example of a largely semantic system:
        classes have names like <code>.btn-danger</code> rather than <code>.btn-red</code>, to make it clear <strong>why</strong>
        you should use a particular class.
