        Dimagiâ€™s product design team firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone,
        regardless of abilities or impairments.

        This guide will help ensure that our experiences meet the standards for
        accessibility required by law (WCAG AA, Section 508, European Standards). Patterns should be perceivable, operable,
        and understable to users, even when using assistive technology.
