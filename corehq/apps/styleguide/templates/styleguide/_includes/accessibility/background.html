        Accessible products give every user the same benefits regardless of ability and can adapt to any user in any
        context. Disabilities can be situational (an end user with typical vision may struggle to view their screen in a
        bright or sunny environment), temporary (a person with a broken wrist may not be able to type in HQ but will regain
        ability when healed), and long-lasting (barriers from birth, an illness, disease, accident, or developed over age;
        some may not condsider themselves to have disabilities even if they experience functional limitations). We design
        and build products for everyone.
